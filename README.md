# Unit Test for React.js Component

This repository contains a simple unit test for a React.js component located in the `unitary-test/src/Components` directory.

## Prerequisites

To run the unit test, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v12.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher) or Yarn (v1.0.0 or higher)

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project and run the unit test:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd unitary-test
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Running the Unit Test

To run the unit test, execute the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

or

```bash
yarn test
```

The test runner will launch and execute the unit tests defined for the React.js component. The test results will be displayed in the console.

## Test Files Location

The unit test files for the React.js component can be found in the `unitary-test/src/Components` directory. The test file has a `.test.js` extension and is usually named after the component being tested.

## Writing Unit Tests

To write additional unit tests for the component, you can create new test files or add tests to existing ones within the `unitary-test/src/Components` directory. Follow the conventions for test file naming and use a testing library like Jest or React Testing Library to write your tests.
